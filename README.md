# Identifying Churn Predictors and Personalized Retention Strategies in a Mobile Gaming App

## Overview

This project analyzes user engagement data from a mobile gaming app to identify key factors contributing to user churn (i.e., users ceasing to use the app).  The analysis employs various data manipulation and machine learning techniques to pinpoint significant predictors of churn.  The ultimate goal is to develop data-driven recommendations for personalized retention strategies aimed at improving user lifetime value. This includes identifying at-risk users and suggesting targeted interventions.

## Technologies Used

* Python 3
* Pandas
* NumPy
* Scikit-learn
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn

## How to Run

This project requires a Python 3 environment with the specified libraries.  To install the necessary dependencies, navigate to the project directory in your terminal and run:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Once the dependencies are installed, you can run the main analysis script:

```bash
python main.py
```

## Example Output

The script will print key findings of the churn analysis to the console, including summaries of significant predictor variables and model performance metrics.  Additionally, the analysis will generate several visualization files (e.g., churn rate over time, feature importance plots) in the `output` directory. These visualizations provide a visual representation of the identified churn patterns and the effectiveness of the proposed retention strategies.  The specific file names and content will depend on the data used and the analysis performed.  Expect output similar to:

* **Console Output:** Summary statistics, model performance metrics (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall), and key insights derived from the analysis.
* **Output Directory:**  Plots visualizing user engagement trends, feature importance, and other relevant findings (e.g., `churn_rate_over_time.png`, `feature_importance.png`).


## Data

The project requires a dataset containing user engagement metrics.  A sample dataset is provided in the `data` folder.  For use with your own data, you will need to modify the data loading section of `main.py` to point to your data file and ensure it has the appropriate format.  The expected format is a CSV file with columns representing user IDs and relevant engagement features.  Please refer to the `data/sample_data.csv` file for an example.
